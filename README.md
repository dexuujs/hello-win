# Hello - a tool ported to Windows
This is a very damn simple tool I decided to port to Windows for absolutely no reason. It is made by GNU and can be installed in Linux using `sudo apt-get install hello`.
## Build
Just use `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc src/hello.c -o bin/hello.exe` in root directory, that's it. The compiled file will be in bin/. Add it to PATH, run it, do whatever you want lol. The only dependency is Min-GW 64.
